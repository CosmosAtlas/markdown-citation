### Converters from html to pdf

- [PrinceXML](https://www.princexml.com/)
    Great for static sites, limited support for javascript. Proprieitary code.
- [html2pdf](https://github.com/eKoopmans/html2pdf)
    It uses a javascript package to take a screenshot of a webpage or it's element. Then uses the picture to generate the PDF. The output is not idea for text.
- Print from browser
    Output pdf result is dependent on browser. Generally produces reasonable result if `print css` settings are set nicely. Print preview is a browser independent feature which results in unpredictable output result for the same webpage. For example, [Midori](http://midori-browser.org/) which is a lightweight browser based on Webkit produces a print page by clearly taking a screenshot and crop to fit page.
