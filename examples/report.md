## Project Report: Extending Markdown with Citations
------

*Wenhan Zhu (Cosmos)*

### Abstract

Markdown is a widely used markup language on the internet. Its simplicity and ease of used made it a great tool for writting blog posts and documentations. Its design allowed it to be extended for more functionality. Many people and organization extended the original Markdown and some of the extensions became standards among users. This report shows an extension of Markdown, by adding citation support through javascript implementation.

### Introduction

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntex. ^[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)] It was first introduced by John Gruber in 2004^[[https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)]. It is designed so that it can be converted to HTML which makes it very popular for blog posts and documentations for readme files.

In the initial implementation, Markdown syntax is very ambiguous, which led to many inconsistencies between different implementations. Due to its wide popularity, people gathered together and formed different organizations to introduce standardization to Markdown. Some of the standardization became commonly adopted such as CommonMark^[[http://commonmark.org/](http://commonmark.org/)] and GitHub Flavored Markdown^[[https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)]. The details of these standardization are discussed in later sections.

I use Markdown in my daily life. However, many times I find it lack some fundamental features that's important for my use. Sometimes these features are implemented by specific Markdown editors or has some work around. Sometimes it's too complicated and it requires more setup. One such feature is proper citation support. There are times that I need to write a short 1~2 page project proposal or technical report that needs a few references but with standard Markdown the work around is to list them manually. Inspired by this problem, the goal of this project is to explore how extensions of Markdown is down in javascript and implement an extension of Markdown that contains all the features that I want.

### Markdown syntax

Due to the nature of Markdown and its standardizations, its syntax translates to subset of HTML tags. Below are some major supported features and its introduction in some standardization. CommonMark is a standardized spec for Markdown fromed by a group of people and now is the base for most Markdown specifications. GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) is an extension by GitHub that's based on CommonMark.

| Markdown Standarization | Supported Syntax |
| - |:-|-|
| Markdown | Hearders, Ordered/Unordered List, Backquotes, Code Blocks Horizontal Rules, Links, Emphasis, Code, Image |
| CommonMark| All above and Fenced Code Blocks, Start number of ordered list. |
| GFM | All above and Tables, Task list, Strkethrough, Autolinks |

Since Markdown is designed to be translated to HTML, naturely HTML code can fall through the translater (parser). This allows Markdown to contain raw HTML code which makes many extension doesn't depend on Markdown Syntax. One such example is math rendering which is discussed later. However, in other situations, HTML fall though might not be enough. There are also safety reasons that an HTML fall though is not good enough and some implementations do not support this feature such as GFM.

### Moltivation

The goal of the project is to implement a extension of Markdown that is powerful enough to satisfy my needs but not make it too complicated. The benefit of Markdown is that I can keep all the text clean in files that are readable.

In a basic Markdown editor, all features of GFM is normally supported and many supports more features such as embedding code execution results in a file. However, these features requires local setup and often won't work out of the box. This project aims to avoid these problems.

The extensions that I want for Markdown are math equation rendering and citations in bibtex style. In an ideal situation, I also want to generate good looking PDF files from the HTML output. Details of these features will be discussed in the implementation section.

Many efforts has been done previously for extending Markdown to support the aforementioned features. Math equation rendering commonly supported by Markdown editors. However, cition support in bibtex style is seldomly seen and most of the implementations requires the exsistence of a local *LaTex* copy.

For my purpose, I want something that's lightweight and works on any computer. So, I looked at javascript solutions. Javascript can be ran in any modern browser environment and browser is now an essential part of everyday computing. Javascript also has a huge number of packages that provide many functionalities. As a result, this project is done by javascript using many open source libraries.

### Pipeline

In order to have a nice looking HTML page translated from Markdown, there are a fews things that needs to be done. First, the Markdown file needs to be parsed and translated to raw HTML content. Then, the raw HTML needs to be processed for adding additional functionality and styling to make it look better.

In this project, an outline of the style and additional functionalities of the page is pre-generated. An element of the generated HTML is allocated to host the HTML output from the Markdown translator. The structure looks like the following.

```HTML
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en-US">
<head>
    <!-- include files for scripting and styling -->
</head>
<body>
    <div id='markdown'>  <!-- To be filled by result from parser --> </div>
    <!-- include javascript files -->
</body>
</html>
```

In the headings, javascript setup code for packages and CSS styling code is loaded. In body section, javascript code is written to read from a Markdown file, parse it and translate it into HTML then replace the content of `<div id='markdown'> </div>` to the translated HTML. Under this structure, extensions can be done in 2 ways.

The first way is using HTML passthrough. When a parser is parsing Markdown content, all text that's not in specific Markdown syntax will remain unmodified. Some natural extensions are done this way. For example, Markdown does not support resizing or centering an image. So instead of using Markdown syntax for including an image, one could simply write the raw HTML code for including an image with all proper properties one would like to set. Math equation rendering support is done using this method.

The other way is to create an extension to the parser. Many parsers support extensions, so we can write plugins for those parsers to accomplish more things. For example, by using regular expressions, an extension can find e-mail addresses and automatically change them into e-mail links. Supporting citation is done using both of the methods for simplicity.

### Implementation

#### Rendering math equations

There are several ways to display math equations in HTML. Display by an image^[[http://latex2png.com/](http://latex2png.com/)], using javascript libraries (MathJax^[[https://www.mathjax.org/](https://www.mathjax.org/)], Katex^[[https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/](https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/)]) or natively through MathML. For my purpose, I want to use *LaTex* equations which is very common for scientific writing and I am very familiar with them. So, I decided to used MathJax to display math equations. By properly setting up MathJax in the HTML outline code, any thing surrounded by `$` such as `$x^2$`
will fall though the parser and in raw HTML will be rendered by MathJax. The reason I chose MathJax over Katex is because MathJax supports for functions from *amsmath*^[[https://ctan.org/pkg/amsmath?lang=en](https://ctan.org/pkg/amsmath?lang=en)] *LaTex* packages. The performance difference between MathJax and Katex in my oppinion is not as important as supporting more features. However, the nice thing about it is that I can easily switch to one or another if I found them more suitable in the future.

#### Citations

##### Bibtex
Bibtex^[[http://www.bibtex.org/](http://www.bibtex.org/)] is originally a tool written for *LaTex* to process lists of references. It's format `.bib` is in plain text and is widely adopted by many reference management software. A tipical bibtex entry looks like this.

```Bibtex
@article{einstein,
    author =       "Albert Einstein",
    title =        "{Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K{\"o}rper}. ({German})
        [{On} the electrodynamics of moving bodies]",
    journal =      "Annalen der Physik",
    volume =       "322",
    number =       "10",
    pages =        "891--921",
    year =         "1905",
    DOI =          "http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/andp.19053221004"
}
```

When citing a source, in *LaTex* the macro is `\cite{einstein}`, an equivalent syntax needs to be defined first in the implementation. The idea in my implementation come from other implementation of the same or similar problem.

##### Footnotes

Footnote is a common Markdown extension that functions like citations but doesn't include proper formatting for academic styling. Footnote's syntax commonly defined as `[^FN]: This is a footnote`, where `[^FN]` indicates it's the location to put the footnote and the text after `:` is the content of the footnote. I decided to used a similar syntax `[@einstein]` for citation. Where the text after `@` is the citation index for Bibtex. The same syntax is also used by RMarkdown^[[https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)].

##### Parsing

By comparing some Markdown parsers implemented in javascript, I decided to used a parser called markdown-it^[[https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it)]. This parser is implemented with proper support for extensions and have more community plugins than other parsers that I've tried. I used another extension of this parser `markdown-it-center-text` as a base and modified it to suit my purpose.

The extension added an extra parsing step that would identify the pattern and replace the text with proper HTML elements. For example, `text[@einstein]` will be replaced with `text<span class="citation">einstein</span>` by the parser. Then with proper CSS styling, the content of the HTML element would be wrapped by square brackets and the result will look like `text[einstein]`. I chose this style because it's my favorite styling for citations.

Due to my lack of knowledge in javascript development, I couldn't find a way build a plugin from ground up. So as a result, I downloaded the extension `markdown-it-center-text` locally and modified the source file.

##### Reference Display

So far, citations in text is properly replaces with HTML elements with tags. Now, we need to display the reference list based on citations used from a bibtex file. I found a javascript library called `bibtex-js` that suits this purpose. This library supports displaying citations by bibtex keys, which other similar libraries lack.

A piece of javascript code is writen to go through HTML elements with `span` elements of class `citation` to retreive the list of bibtex keys and add the bibtex keys to the HTML element where all reference will be displayed.

### Results

#### Final HTML

With proper CSS styling added, the result of the implementation renders nicely in a browser. Below lists the additional packages I used and their purposes.

- prismjs^[[https://prismjs.com/](https://prismjs.com/)] (Syntax hightlighting for code segments)
- Picnic CSS^[[https://picnicss.com/](https://picnicss.com/)] (lightweight styling for HTML elements)
- jQuery^[[https://jquery.com/](https://jquery.com/)] (read text from a file for reading Markdown)

#### PDF output

One of the features that most Markdown editors have but give inconsistence result is converting to PDF. In my experience are 2 common ways to do this. The first is to render the HTML output in a browser and utilize the browser's build in print to file feature. The other is to convert Markdown to *LaTex* then to PDF. The previous method requires proper print CSS styling and the later often requires a local installation of *LaTex*.

In this project, I considered the first method. By opening a live server on my machine to avoid the some-origin policy^[[https://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/Same_Origin_Policy](https://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/Same_Origin_Policy)], a webpage converted from Markdown will be opened in a browser then using the print to file feature to retreive a PDF file. To my surprise, different browsers behave very differently from each other. Browsers use different rendering engines and when trying to print a Webpage, different browsers use different techniques. In my personal experience, Chrome would often give the best result and followed by Firefox. Other browsers such like Midori simply give a cropped screenshot of the webpage which is far from satisfiable.

#### Future improvements

Currently, this project serves more like a proof of concept. Every bit of the process is explored and implemented. However, there are more things that could be done to improve the project. Below are some directions and my thoughts on them.

#### Portability

Before this project, my main editor for Markdown is using `atom`^[[https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/)] with a plugin called `Markdown Preview Enhanced`^[[https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced](https://github.com/shd101wyy/markdown-preview-enhanced)]. This plugin supports most features I want and supports custom CSS styling. However, like previously discussed many features require some additional software installed on the machine. For example, a beta citation functionality of this plugin needs *LaTex* exsist locally to process the citation list. `Markdown Preview Enhanced` uses the same parser as I am using in the background. It also supports plugins so it might be possible to integrate the features I implemented into this plugin.

#### Citation styles

Currently, the style of the citations are copied from the examples given by `bibtex-js`. A list of common citation styles can be implemented so that by setting these properties the outline HTML, the extension would display them in different styles.

The current syntax `[@cite]` requires the text to be matched exactly with bibtex entry and will not changed the content when displayed. Some citation style display citations in numbers. Future enhancements to the extension could incorporate these requirements and produce a wide variety of reference styles.

### Conclusion

The project showed the extensibility of Markdown and implemented an extension to support citations in Markdown though parser and outline HTML setup. This report is writen in Markdown and produced by the extension. Compared to the version during presentation, all features are implemented and many style changes has been made for better print output. For example, the font family is changed to *Times New Roman* and `media` information in CSS has been changed to have proper margins.

I think thee current extension would satisfy my purpose of rendering math equations and supports bibtex style citations. The only dependency of the project is a web browser. Services like GitHub Pages^[[https://pages.github.com/](https://pages.github.com/)] can properly host the project. This report can be find online [here](https://atep-wz.github.io/markdown-citation/index.html). In order to showcase all functionality of the project. The following showcase section contains an example of math equation and citation. References in this report uses footnotes since there is no academic references.



### Showcase
Maxwell's Equations[@cla14]
$$ \nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{B}} -\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{\partial t}  = \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{\mathbf{j}}    $$
$$ \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{E}}  = 4 \pi \rho  $$
$$ \nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{E}}\, +\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t}  = \vec{\mathbf{0}} $$
$$ \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{B}}  = 0 $$

### Appendix
#### HTML generated content for reference
In the outline HTML, the setup code block is the following

```html
  <div id="bibtex_display">
    <div class="if bibtex_template" style="display: none;">
      <h3> References </h4>
      <ul style="list-style:none; padding-left: 0;"> <li>
        <span class="if journal !nolink">
          <a class="bibtexVar" extra="BIBTEXKEY">
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="title"></span>,
          </a>
        </span>
        <span class="if title nolink">
              <span class="title"></span>,
        </span>
        <div class="if author">
          <span class="author"></span>
        </div>
        <div>
          <span class="if journal"><em><span class="journal"></span></em>,</span>
          <span class="if booktitle">In <em><span class="booktitle"></span></em>,</span>
          <span class="if editor"><span class="editor"></span> (editors),</span>
          <span class="if publisher"><em><span class="publisher"></span></em>,</span>
          <span class="if !journal number">Technical report <span class="number"></span>,</span>
          <span class="if institution"><span class="institution"></span>,</span>
          <span class="if address"><span class="address"></span>,</span>
          <span class="if volume"><span class="volume"></span>,</span>
          <span class="if journal number">(<span class="number"></span>),</span>
          <span class="if pages"> pages <span class="pages"></span>,</span>
          <span class="if month"><span class="month"></span>,</span>
          <span class="if year"><span class="year"></span>.</span>
          <span class="if note"><span class="note"></span>.</span>
          <a class="bibtexVar" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#bib+BIBTEXKEY+" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="bib+BIBTEXKEY+" extra="BIBTEXKEY">
  		</a>
        </div>
        <div style="display:none"><span class="bibtextype"></span></div>
        <div style="display:none"><span class="if topic"><span class="topic"></span></span></div>
      </li></ul>
    </div>
```

The javascript library I used supports the  feature of only displaying citations with specific bibtex keys. So I wrote a piece of javascript code that adds the bibtex keys used in the main text the `div` element with `id="bibtex_display"`. And the final resulting generated reference section will be the following. Extra white space is deleted for ease of read.

```html
<div id="bibtex_display" bibtexkeys="cla14">
<div class="if bibtexentry" style="">
      <h3> References </h3>
      <ul style="list-style:none; padding-left: 0;"> <li>
        <span class="">
          <a class="bibtexVar" extra="BIBTEXKEY">
              <span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="title">The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Mathematics</span>,
          </a>
        </span>        
        <div class="">
          <span class="author">Christopher Clapham, James Nicholson</span>
        </div>
        <div>          
          <span class=""><em><span class="publisher">Oxford University Press</span></em>,</span>
          <span class=""><span class="month">July</span>,</span>
          <span class=""><span class="year">2014</span>.</span>          
          <a class="bibtexVar" role="button" data-toggle="collapse" href="#bibcla14" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="bibcla14" extra="BIBTEXKEY">
  		</a>
        </div>
        <div style="display:none"><span class="bibtextype"></span></div>
        <div style="display:none"></div>
      </li></ul>
    </div></div>
```

In the given bibtex example, there are *LaTex* macros for special characters. The javascrip library I used have a dictionary that converts these to unicode. ^[[https://github.com/pcooksey/bibtex-js/blob/master/src/bibtex_js.js#L1192](https://github.com/pcooksey/bibtex-js/blob/master/src/bibtex_js.js#L1192)]
